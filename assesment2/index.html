                <h2>Pythagoras</h2>
                <p>
                    Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570 – c. 495 BC)[b] was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher and the eponymous founder of Pythagoreanism. 
                    His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through 
                    them, Western philosophy. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a gem-engraver 
                    on the island of Samos. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, 
                    he travelled to Croton, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle.

                <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>
                <p>
                    Srinivasa Ramanujan( 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. 
                    Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, 
                    infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan initially 
                    developed his own mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed 
                    for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered"

                <h2>Archimedes</h2>
                <p>
                   Archimedes of Syracuse  was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, 
                    he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one 
                    of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and 
                    the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and 
                    volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola.
